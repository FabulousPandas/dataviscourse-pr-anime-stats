Project Website:
https://fabulouspandas.github.io/dataviscourse-pr-anime-stats/

For our Project Milestone, we are submitting 2 of our charts: our line graph and bar graph.
Our line graph is drawn in the js folder in line.js.
Our bar graph is drawn in the js folder in bars.js.

All the data for these graphs are under the data folder where we have multiple json files
where we have less data such as the small_anime_genres and bigger datasets in the medium_anime_genres.

Our html file is named index.html and contains the views for our graphs to be drawn on.

When you navigate to the Project Website, you are greeted with our two graphs drawn with 4 pre-selected
genres. You can select or deselect genres at the top to have them display on both the line and bar graph.
The line and bar graphs have matching color codes.

Known Problems:
Our line graph x-axis is a bit off as the lines don't go off to the very end. We also want to make the y-axis
scrolling as you go down the x-axis however we did not have the time to add that in.
Our seasons drawn out at the bottom of the x-axis is also overlapping and will be fixed later.
