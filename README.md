Project Website:
https://fabulouspandas.github.io/dataviscourse-pr-anime-stats/

For our Final Project Submission, we are submitting 3 charts: our line graph, bar graph and bump graph.
Our line graph is drawn in the js folder in line.js.
Our bar graph is drawn in the js folder in bars.js.
Our bump graph is drawn in the js folder in bump.js

All the data for these graphs are under the data folder where we have multiple json files
where we have less data such as the small_anime_genres and bigger datasets in the large_anime_genres.

Our html file is named index.html and contains the views for our graphs to be drawn on.

When you navigate to the Project Website, you are greeted with a banner of our team's name at the top with 
the line chart following below. At the top of the page is our legend that stays at the top when you scroll down
along with an interactive side bar on the right that lets you filter out genres/themes/demographics on our charts. 
There are 4 pre-selected genres and you can select a max of 10 genres at a time. Selecting or deselecting a genre 
will change all 3 charts and all of the charts have matching color codes.

Known Problems:
Our bump chart doesn't write out the year 2022 at the end of the x-axis however data still shows up for that year above it.
